Leap of faith is an experimental graphics engine to serve as the basis for a show-case on the adventures of [Albert Rodriguez Franco](https://www.linkedin.com/in/albertrodriguezfranco/) and his learning on Computer Graphics APIs and techniques.

Currently the development is focused on Vulkan although the ultimate mission would be to abstract the engine to in such a way that it could support other low-level graphics API such as DirectX 12.

You can follow the steps and decisions on development of the engine on its own [blog](https://unclefirefox.github.io/LeapOfFaith)

## Getting Started
Leap of Faith is currently a Windows build only. Open the solution at the root of the repository with Visual Studio 2019 and compile. You should have everything you need inside the repository to get it running.

## Current state
The engine can only paint simple shapes on-screen using a vertex buffer and no camera. This will develop more in the future
